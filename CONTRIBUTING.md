## Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues:** Someone might already be working on it
2. **Open an issue:** Discuss major changes before investing time
3. **Read the license:** Understand the [licensing terms](LICENSE)
4. **Keep the tone:** Maintain the friendly, accessible style

### Contribution Process

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github-rimomcosta:YOUR_USERNAME/Transformers-for-absolute-dummies.git
   cd Transformers-for-absolute-dummies
   ```

2. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR)
   - Test your changes thoroughly

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Explain why the change is valuable

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `Add: new section on flash attention`
- `Fix: typo in chapter 5, paragraph 3`
- `Improve: clarity of attention mechanism explanation`
- `Update: diagram for multi-head attention`
- `Docs: add setup instructions for PyTorch`

### Code Style (for code contributions)

- **Python:** Follow PEP 8, use type hints
- **Comments:** Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- **Naming:** Clear, descriptive variable names
- **Documentation:** Docstrings for all functions/classes

Example:
```python
def calculate_attention_scores(query: np.ndarray, key: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculate attention scores between query and key vectors.
    
    Args:
        query: Query vector of shape (d_k,)
        key: Key vector of shape (d_k,)
        
    Returns:
        Attention score (scalar value)
        
    Example:
        >>> query = np.array([1.0, 0.5])
        >>> key = np.array([0.8, 0.6])
        >>> calculate_attention_scores(query, key)
        1.1
    """
    return np.dot(query, key)
```

### Content Style (for written contributions)

#### Tone
- **Friendly and encouraging:** "Great! Now let's see..."
- **Avoid condescension:** Never "Obviously..." or "Simply..."
- **Inclusive language:** Use "we" and "our"

#### Structure
- **Short paragraphs:** 3-5 sentences max
- **Clear headings:** Descriptive and hierarchical
- **Examples first:** Show, then explain
- **Multiple perspectives:** Kid-friendly AND technical

#### Formatting
- **Bold** for emphasis
- `code` for technical terms
- > Blockquotes for important notes
- Lists for clarity
- Tables for comparisons

#### Math Notation
- Define symbols before using them
- Use LaTeX for complex equations: `$E = mc^2$`
- Show numerical examples after formulas
- Explain in words what the math means

Example:
```markdown
### Understanding the Dot Product

The **dot product** measures similarity between two vectors. 

**Formula:**
$\text{score} = \vec{q} \cdot \vec{k} = q_1 k_1 + q_2 k_2 + ... + q_n k_n$

**Example:**
Query: $\vec{q} = [1.0, 0.5]$
Key: $\vec{k} = [0.8, 0.6]$

$\text{score} = (1.0 \times 0.8) + (0.5 \times 0.6) = 0.8 + 0.3 = 1.1$

**Intuition:** Higher scores mean the vectors point in similar directions!
```
